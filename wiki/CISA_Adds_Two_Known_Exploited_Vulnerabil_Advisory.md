# CISA Adds Two Known Exploited Vulnerabilities to Catalog

### 🛡️ Threat Overview
<p>CISA has added&nbsp;two&nbsp;new&nbsp;vulnerabilities&nbsp;to its&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cisa.gov/known-exploited-vulnerabilities-catalog">Known Exploited Vulnerabilities (KEV) Catalog</a>, based on evidence of active exploitation.&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2022-20775" target="_blank">CVE-2022-20775</a>&nbsp;Cisco&nbsp;Catalyst&nbsp;SD-WAN Path Traversal Vulnerability</li>
<li><a href="https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2026-20127" target="_blank">CVE-2026-20127</a>&nbsp;Cisco Catalyst SD-WAN Controller and Manager Authentication Bypass Vulnerability&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p>These&nbsp;types&nbsp;of vulnerabilities&nbsp;are&nbsp;frequent attack vectors&nbsp;for malicious cyber actors and pose&nbsp;significant risks to the federal enterprise.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://www.cisa.gov/binding-operational-directive-22-01">Binding Operational Directive (BOD) 22-01: Reducing the Significant Risk of Known Exploited Vulnerabilities</a>&nbsp;established the KEV&nbsp;Catalog as a living list of known Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVEs) that carry significant risk to the federal enterprise. BOD 22-01 requires Federal Civilian Executive Branch (FCEB) agencies to remediate identified vulnerabilities by the due date to protect FCEB networks against active threats. See the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/publications/Reducing_the_Significant_Risk_of_Known_Exploited_Vulnerabilities_211103.pdf">BOD 22-01 Fact Sheet</a>&nbsp;for more information.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Although BOD 22-01 only applies to FCEB agencies, CISA strongly urges all organizations to reduce their exposure to cyberattacks by prioritizing&nbsp;timely&nbsp;remediation of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cisa.gov/known-exploited-vulnerabilities-catalog">KEV Catalog vulnerabilities</a>&nbsp;as part of their vulnerability management practice. CISA will continue to add vulnerabilities to the catalog that meet the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cisa.gov/known-exploited-vulnerabilities">specified criteria</a>.</p>

# AegisShield: Product Guidelines

## 🛡️ Brand Personality (UX Voice)
*   **Precise:** Clean data, no fluff. Communications should be direct and technical yet accessible.
*   **Calm but Powerful:** Authority through stability and prediction. The UI should inspire confidence, not panic.
*   **Trustworthy Tech:** High-tech aesthetic that emphasizes security and reliability.
*   **Minimalist:** High signal, low noise. Prioritize actionable insights over raw data volume.

## 🎨 Design System (Cyber-Premium)
### Color Palette
- **Primary:** Neon Magenta (`#FF4FD8`) & Electric Cyan (`#35F2FF`) for highlights and interactivity.
- **Background:** Deep Space (`#0B0F1A`) with Midnight Panel (`#121829`) for surfaces.
- **Supporting:** Success Green (`#3CFFB0`) and Soft Glow Blue (`#6BE6FF`).

### Typography
- **Primary:** `Inter` or `Space Grotesk` (Geometric & Clean).
- **Display:** `Orbitron` (Used sparingly for high-impact headings).

### Effects & Components
- **Glassmorphism:** Use backgrounds with `rgba(18, 24, 41, 0.7)`, `blur(12px)`, and subtle borders.
- **Glow Rules:** Apply standard neon glows to active states and primary CTAs.
- **Buttons:** Gradient fills for primary actions; cyan outlines for secondary.

## 🎬 Motion & Interaction
- **Signature Motions:** Soft pulse glow for "Live" status and micro-scale (1.03) on hover.
- **Timings:** Normal (200ms) for most transitions to maintain a "calm" feel.
- **Feedback:** Shimmer effects for scanning operations and premium item highlights.

## ✍️ Editorial Guidelines
- Use **Active Voice** for autonomous actions (e.g., "AegisShield blocked a threat" vs "A threat was blocked").
- Avoid security jargon where possible, but maintain technical accuracy.
- The **Consultant Log** should read like a briefing from a senior security expert: concise, strategic, and calm.

# AegisShield: Product Guide

## Strategic Vision
AegisShield is the world’s first **Predictive Autonomous Security Defender**. It bridges the massive gap between raw data (logs/alerts) and actionable protection. While industry leaders (Sucuri, Cloudflare, Snyk) focus on reactive blocking, AegisShield uses **Predictive Active Shielding (PAS)** to forecast attacks and autonomously harden domain defenses *before* the first packet is fired.

## Core Value Propositions
1.  **Shielding vs. Reactivity:** We stop the "Whack-a-Mole" game. AegisShield hardens your infrastructure based on forecasted intent, not just seen signatures.
2.  **Expertise vs. Data:** We eliminate the "Expertise Void" by acting as an autonomous defender that explains *why* it just reinforced your security posture.
3.  **Context vs. Scale:** We eliminate "Contextual Blindness" by deploying custom "Virtual Patches" tailored to your domain's specific tech-stack.

## Target Audience
- **SMEs & Enterprise Security Teams:** Who need autonomous protection without 24/7 manual oversight.
- **SaaS Providers:** Looking to harden their infrastructure against zero-day exploits.
- **DevOps Engineers:** Who require high-signal security logs and automated mitigation roadmaps.

## Core Functional Architecture
- **Expert Entry (Home):** Domain diagnosis and zero-config scanning.
- **Onboarding:** Domain ownership verification and Autonomous Red-Teaming (ART).
- **SOC Dashboard:** Active Shielding HUD with real-time defensive posture indicators.
- **AI Consultant & Shield:** Predictive Active Shielding (PAS) and a human-readable Consultant Log.
- **ML Detection Lab:** Custom model training and dataset verification.

## Success Metrics
- **Mean Time to Shield (MTTS):** Reducing the time between threat detection and mitigation to milliseconds.
- **Prediction Accuracy:** Maintaining high precision in forecasting malicious intent.
- **Autonomous Efficacy:** Percentage of threats mitigated without manual intervention.

# 🛡️ AegisShield: Universal AI Security Controller (C2)

**AegisShield** is a professional-grade, autonomous security framework. It evolves your server from a passive target into a **Thinking, Deceptive Fortress**. By combining local Small Language Models (SLM) with active network countermeasures, it identifies, traps, and neutralizes threats across multiple projects simultaneously.

## 🏗️ The C2 (Command & Control) Architecture

### 🤖 Semantic Intelligence (v4.0)
AegisShield doesn't just match patterns—it understands logic.
- **Self-Healing Code:** The AI autonomously re-writes dangerous code in a sandbox (Digital Twin) and verifies it before suggesting a patch.
- **Behavioral SOC:** Identifies slow-drip reconnaissance and zero-day threats by analyzing traffic intent semantically.

### 🎭 Morphing Deception
Mislead attackers by changing your server's DNA.
- **The Masquerade:** Automatically detects your tech stack and masquerades as a different server (e.g., BlackBerry BES) to frustrate fingerprinting.
- **Ghost Tripwires:** Opens non-responsive high-value ports (FTP, RDP) that trigger immediate kernel-level IP quarantine.

### 🕸️ Active Tarpitting
Exhaust attacker resources. AegisShield holds suspicious connections open for extended periods, slowing down scanners and bots to a crawl.

## 🚀 Deployment

Launch the full-screen Security HUD:

```bash
cd aegisshield
./shield.sh dashboard
```

### 📋 Consolidated Actionable Intelligence: `FIX_LIST.md`
A master checklist generated in your project root, providing:
- **Precise Locations:** Exact file and line numbers.
- **AI-Generated Fixes:** Direct code rewrites for logic flaws.
- **Multi-Node Coverage:** A single report for every directory under AegisShield protection.

---

## 🛠️ Management CLI
- `./shield.sh add-node <path>`: Register a new folder for full protection.
- `./shield.sh status`: View all protected nodes and system health.
- `./shield.sh garbage-collect`: Manually trigger storage optimization.
- `./shield.sh setup-cron`: Install system-level persistence.
